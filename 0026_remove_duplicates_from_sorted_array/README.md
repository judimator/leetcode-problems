# The problem

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then _return the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first k elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
Return k.Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

### Example 1:

**Input:** head = [1,1,2]  
**Output:** 2

### Example 2:

**Input:** head = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]  
**Output:** 5
