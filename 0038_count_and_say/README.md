# The task

The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1)`.
- 
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `"3322251"` we replace `"33"` with `"23"`, replace `"222"` with `"32"`, replace `"5"` with `"15"` and replace `"1"` with `"11"`. Thus the compressed string becomes `"23321511"`.

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _element of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

### Example 1:

**Input:** n = 4  
**Output:** "1211"

### Example 2:

**Input:** n = 1   
**Output:** "1"
