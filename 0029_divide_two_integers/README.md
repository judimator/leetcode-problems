# The Task

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`_.

### Example 1:

**Input:** dividend = 10, divisor = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

### Example 1:

**Input:** dividend = 7, divisor = -3
**Output:** -2
**Explanation:** 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
